# Write .txt

### The Problem

Open a .txt file called data.txt and read it. Then write both the first and the last line separated by an extra blank line.

The new .txt file should be named write_x.txt where **x** is the extension of the files written in that language.

### Input >> Desired Output / Test Cases

Python => write_py.txt

JavaScript => write_js.txt

Go => write_go.txt
